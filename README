DO NOT include *.o files in the repo! This can easily be avoided by running 'make clean' before making edits.
DO NOT make commits which throw warnings or errors.

There is one extra compiler flag:
SAVE_TPM skips the TPM functions which wear down the TPM over time (ie. NVWriteValue())
Example: make SAVE_TPM=TRUE

You can do either a release or a debug build:
$ make release
$ make debug
